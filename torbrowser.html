            <h2>Using the Tor Browser</h2>
            <p>
                The Tor browser is a free, open-source software that allows users to browse the internet anonymously. It is the primary tool used to access the dark web and .onion sites. Tor stands for "The Onion Router," which is a reference to the multiple layers of encryption used to protect user privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you use the Tor browser, your internet traffic is routed through a network of volunteer-operated servers called relays. Each relay decrypts a layer of encryption, revealing the next relay's destination, and then forwards the remaining encrypted data. This process makes it extremely difficult for anyone to trace your online activity back to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                To start using the Tor browser, download it from the official Tor Project website, install it, and follow the instructions to connect to the Tor network. Once connected, you can begin browsing .onion sites or use the Tor browser to access regular websites anonymously.
