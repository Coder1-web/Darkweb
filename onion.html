            <h2>Understanding .onion Sites</h2>
            <p>
                .onion sites are special-purpose top-level domain suffixes designating an anonymous hidden service reachable via the Tor network. Unlike traditional domain names, which are registered and maintained by central authorities, .onion domains are generated using cryptographic keys, making them much harder to track and trace back to their owners.
            </p>
            <p>
                These sites can only be accessed using the Tor browser, which routes your internet traffic through multiple layers of encryption, masking your IP address and providing anonymity. This makes .onion sites popular for both legal and illegal activities, as they offer a higher level of privacy compared to regular websites.
