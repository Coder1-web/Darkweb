            <h2>Legal Implications of Using the Dark Web</h2>
            <p>
                While the dark web itself is not illegal, many activities that take place on it are. Accessing or participating in illegal activities on the dark web can result in severe legal consequences, including fines and imprisonment. It's crucial to understand the laws in your country regarding the use of the dark web and to avoid engaging in any illegal activities.

            <p>
                Law enforcement agencies actively monitor the dark web for illegal activities, and they have the tools to identify and prosecute individuals who break the law. Even though the dark web provides anonymity, it is not a guarantee of complete safety from legal repercussions.
